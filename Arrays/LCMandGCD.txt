LCM And GCD

Given two numbers A and B. The task is to find out their LCM and GCD.

Example 1:

Input:
A = 5 , B = 10
Output:
10 5
Explanation:
LCM of 5 and 10 is 10, while
thier GCD is 5.
Example 2:

Input:
A = 14 , B = 8
Output:
56 2
Explanation:
LCM of 14 and 8 is 56, while
thier GCD is 2.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function lcmAndGcd() which takes an Integer N as input and returns a List of two Integers, the required LCM and GCD.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(min(A, B))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

class Solution {
    static Long[] lcmAndGcd(Long A, Long B) {
        Long[] result = new Long[2];

        // compute GCD using Euclid's algorithm
        Long a = A, b = B;
        while (b != 0) {
            Long temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        result[1] = a; // store GCD

        // compute LCM using formula LCM = (A * B) / GCD
        result[0] = (A * B) / a;

        return result;
    }
}
